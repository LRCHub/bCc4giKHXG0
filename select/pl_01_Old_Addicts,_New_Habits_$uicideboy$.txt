(This a $crim beat)
(It's a smash)
(7th Ward)
No, no, you make a right on Paris
(7th Ward)
And, no you pass the mural
(7th Ward)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, by that,
by that fucking sketchy gas station
(7th Ward)
Yeah, right there in the,
in the fucking 7th Ward
Riding through Gentilly
in the '85 Fleetwood
Coral leather seats,
bone body with a teal hood
Albino alligator boots,
bitch, I feel good
Big dog status, flickin' ashes,
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Shrug emoticon, the *59 Don,
always puffin' Indica
Keep the hoes huffin', lick my nuts
I could give a fuck
what you think
Grey clouds start to
form when you speak
I'm 'bout to,
I'm 'bout to grab the umbrella
out the suicide door
Bob Breck reporting to you live
from the storm
I don't wanna die in the 504
Ads spamming $uicide
alive and on tour
These days I'm feeling blessed
Just to be bored, instead of being
blacked out on the floor
Oh my Lord, what's the score?
A brand new form
North, Northside
Northside, Northside
North, North, Northside
Northside, Northside
Yeah, keep my cup dirty,
but I mean well,
praying I don't see hell
Cumming inside my bitch in hopes
she get a baby to cradle
Hating like someone paid them,
got people there ain't no saving
One of my homies,
he kicked the dope but now
he stuck on the kratom
Okay then,
walk in a room full of people
taking credit like they made us
Homies that I call friends,
now they suing, I'm like okay, fuck
Hating up on the net,
but face to face
it never get brought up
Why when I get my flowers
I smell piss up in the water?
Yeah, hop on the live for a minute,
get me a plaque off a snippet
If they ain't with GREY,
then fuck all these rappers,
you know I'm a bigot
Possessed when I hit the stage,
I show 'em something religious
Been upping my muhfuckin' meds
'cause I been waking up tempted
Every day, feel like I'm dying,
filled with anxiety, panicking
On the dark side of the Northside,
skywalking like Anakin
Keep me a chip
on my shoulder so much,
you would think that I rather it
Straight out the muhfuckin'
underground, yeah,
I'm straight out the labyrinth
Breaking the habit,
breaking the habit
Breaking the habit,
load up the ratchet
Bloody the sabbath,
fill up the caskets
Everything grey but the carrots,
yeah, GREY till the maggots
